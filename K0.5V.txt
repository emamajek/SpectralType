K0.5V

None of the K0.5V standards proposed by either Keenan or Gray has been
consistently called K0.5V by other authors.  I would probably need to
compare these stars to K0V and K1V primary standards to see just how
intermediate they are. Thus far I wouldn't adopt any of them blindly
as a "K0.5V" standard. 

Keenan80 standard:   HD 124752 - K0.5V
Keenan83 standard:   HD 125752 - K0.5V 
Keenan88 standard:   HD 124752 - K0.5V
Keenan89 standard:   ome^2 Eri (=HD 26965) - K0.5V
Keenan99 standard:   HD 3651 - K0.5V 
GrayNstars standard: ome^2 Eri - K0.5V

Teff(K0.5V) = 5162 +- 21 K ; deprecated standard GJ 166A (Pecaut13)

BCv(K0.5V) = -0.255 +- 0.02 ; deprecated standard GJ 166A (Pecaut13)

# Deprecated Standards

HD 3651 = 54 Psc = HR 166 (J0039+2115)
  K0V: MK43,JM53,Wilson62(Balmer lines weak, CN strong),Jaschek64(all),Cowley67,HoukStandard,Gray03
  K0+V: Hoffleit91
  K0.5V: Keenan89(stan)
  K1: Bidelman85
  K2V: Yoss61

  Decent agreement among MK43, JM53, Cowley, Houk, Gray on K0V
  subtype, but Keenan89 later calls it K0.5V standard.

HD 124752 = HIP 69400 = BD+67_771 (J1412+6735)
  K0V: Cannon(K0),Roman49,JM53,Jaschek64(all)
  K0.5V: Keenan80,Keenan89
  K0-V: Gray03
  K1V: Wilson50,LevatoAbt78

  5" binary with M2V star (Gray03). Ursa Major member?  Type has
  migrated among the experts from K0V to K1V, indeed JM53, Keenan, and
  Gray all disagree on subtype.  Probably not the best choice of
  standard.

HD 26965 = omi^2 Eri = GJ 166A = HR 1325 (J0415-0739)
  K0V: Wilson62,Morgan65,Keenan99
  K0.5V: GrayNstars(stan),Gray06
  K1V: Roman55,Bidelman85(K1),Gray03
  G9V: Abt85
  
  Morgan65 calls omi2 Eri the K0V "fundamental classification
  standard". Then of course it isn't, and wasn't mentioned as such
  later (e.g. MK73). Poor agreement among authors.
