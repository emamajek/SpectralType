F4III

36 Per could be considered a secondary standard (from JM53), but there
are no well-used modern standards for F4III.

JM53 standard:		36 Per - F4III
Abt68 standard:		36 Per - F4III
MorganAbt72 standard:   55 Eri (ft) (=HR 1505) - F4IIIp
Cowley74 standard:	36 Per - F4III

(J-H)(F4III)  = 0.172 ; smoothed relation from giants in Skiff compendium w/i 15 deg of NGP, 2MASS photometry AAA flags
=> adopt (J-H)(F4III)  = 0.172 [updated 10/30/2020]

(H-Ks)(F4III) = 0.069 ; smoothed relation from giants in Skiff compendium w/i 15 deg of NGP, 2MASS photometry AAA flags
=> adopt (H-Ks)(F4III) = 0.069 [updated 10/30/2020]


# No standards

MK43, Houk, MK78, GrayNstars, and GrayCorbally10 do not list a F4III standard

   The "standard" is the slightly fainter and northwestern of a 9"
   pair of stars of similar magnitude (V ~ 6.8). The companion is a
   late G-giant.  Other than MorgantAbt72's use of this star as a
   standard (with notably peculiar spectrum), no one else has used
   this star as a standard.
