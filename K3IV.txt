K3IV

Keenan89 does not list a K3IV standard.

MK43 standard: del And - K3 III-IV 

Stromberg30(1930ApJ....71..175S) first noted the existence of
subgiants, and commented that while there appear to be K0-K2
subgiants, an analogous K3-K9 subgiant and M subgiant population
didn't seem to exist ("Among stars of spectral class K3-K9 subgiants
do not seem to occur.". So the apparent edge of the subgiant
population around K2/K3 was obvious even around 1930.  In recent
years, luminosity class "IV" - often used for MK classifications of
subgiants, has also been used for some pre-MS stars whose gravities
and absolute magnitudes appear to be intermediate between dwarfs and
giants - even if they don't correspond to the classic post-MS subgiant
population for the stars hotter than ~K3.

Gray03 lists 1 K3IV star (HIP 21482 = HD 283750; K3IVke) and 3 K3IV-V
stars, and Gray06 lists one K3IV star (HIP 69972 = HD
125072). Unfortunately, both HD 283750 and HD 125072 are consistent
with being dwarfs on the HRD.

HR 4252 (HD 94386) is the only star classified K3IV in the Bright Star
Catalog 5th ed. (Hoffleit91). Classification seems to come from Evans64. 

There are three "K3IV" in the Hipparcos catalog within 75 pc, but 
remarkably all have absolute magnitudes consistent with being
main sequence stars with Mv ~ 6-7. 

Among Gray03 and Gray06 stars within 40 pc (only HIP 21482 & 69972):
B-V(K3IV) = 1.060 (+- 0.044 sem, +- 0.062 stdev; N=2)
V-I(G0IV) = 1.100 (+- 0.080 sem, +- 0.113 stdev; N=2)

# Non-standards

HD 283750 = HIP 21482 = 
  K3IVke: Gray03
  K2.5Ve: Keenan89
  K2: Nestorov95
  
  DC white dwarf 124" away. B-V = 1.104, Mv=6.83, star is 0.17 mag
  above MS, so its a dwarf.

HD 125072 = HIP 69972 =
  K3V: Evans57,Schade53(K3),Houk75,Jaschek64(all)
  K3IV: Gray06
  K0: Cannon
  K3-K5: Loden76
  
  B-V=1.016, revised HIP => Mv=6.30, only 0.36 mag above MS.
  Clearly a dwarf. But possibly a good candidate K3V standard?
