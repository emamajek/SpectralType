These files represent notes on estimating the mean stellar properties of stars
of a given spectral type. Notes are most complete for O3-M9 luminosity class V (dwarf, main sequence) stars,
with less coverage for cooler/later types, and for types of higher (VI) or lower
(IV, III, II, I) luminosity classes. I have attempted to investigate the "pedigree"
of all spectral standard stars through listing their spectral classifications over
the years. I have graded the spectral standard stars accordingly based on the
continuity of their use by expert classifiers. Standards are graded as: 

"anchor" standards are the best available, rare, bright standard stars showing 
continuity in classification since the 1940s; as classified by Garrison (1994; 
http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1994ASPC...60....3G). E.g. Fomalhaut is a A3V anchor standard 
that basically defines the subtype, and regularly appeared in the literature as a A3V standard 
since the 1940s. Basically, everyone agrees with the "anchor" spectral types or they are
not really classifying on the modern MK system. 

"primary" standards are usually the best standards available, usually with continuity in 
classifications by expert classifiers going back more than a couple decades (with exceptions),
but their continuity in classification may not necessarily go back to the 1940s-1970s. 
Good example: HD 27808 (F8V), which has only been consistently used as a F8V standard
since Morgan & Keenan (1973), especially by e.g. Keenan (1980s) and in the surveys
 by Gray and collaborators since the 1980s. 

"secondary": OK spectral standards, although there may be some minor/negligible differences
in classifications amongst expert classifiers. Example: 36 UMa - another F8V standard, one
that was in common use in the 1940s and 1950s - rarely mentioned in the 70s and 80s, but
a modern survey (e.g. Gray et al. 2003) classified it F8V when comparing to other neighboring
standards. Still a good standard, but notably missing from a few key compilations 
(e.g. Morgan & Keenan 1973, Morgan, Abt, Tapscott (1978), etc.). 

"tertiary": OK spectral standards, but not the best available. Perhaps with multiple differences
in classifications amongst expert classifiers, or perhaps the star has some other issue
(e.g. multiplicity). 

"variant": standard star which may have a flag due to some spectral characteristic (usually
related to metallicity). 

"depricated" standards are "standard" stars in name only. THESE SHOULD PROBABLY BE AVOID AS STANDARD 
STAR as there are likely not only differences in the classifications amongst expert classifiers, but
the expert classifiers *themselves* may have readjusted the classifications over the years (sometimes
multiple times!). 

"candidate" standards are stars that I've found in the literature which appear to have 
good agreement in spectral classification among several investigators, and may be worth
considering as spectral standards. The UR group has taken spectra of a few of these stars
with the SMARTS 1.5-m and concluded that they appear normal enough, and their subtypes
are consistent with being intermediate in classification with stars of slightly hotter and cooler 
subtypes, that they could reasonably serve as standards. Examples are: HD 158352 (A8V;
upgraded to primary standard after Pecaut et al. 2012), HD 73450 (A9V; upgraded
to primary standard after Pecaut et al. 2012), HIP 111288 (K8V k; upgraded to primary standard
after Pecaut et al. 2012), and HIP 3261 (K9V; upgraded to primary standard after Pecaut et al.
2012). Other "candidate" standard stars are listed that we do not taken spectra of, but
which have good agreement amongst published classifications. 

There are examples of stars whose disagreements in classifications over the years by expert
classifiers (and themselves!) would seem to disqualify them from being listed as a 
primary/secondary/tertiary standard, but which have been graded as such (and not depricated). 
This is usually out of desperation, since spectral standards with betterpedigrees (historical 
continuity in classifications over the decades) may not be available. An excellent example of such 
a star is 16 Cygni B, which is likely to be the best available "G3V" standard star (as it appears in 
Keenan's 1985, 1988, and 1989 compilations), however Keenan himself classified it previously as G5V 
(Keenan & McNeil 1976), G4V (Keenan & Pitts 1980), and G2.5V (Keenan 1983). Unfortunately,
*this* star has the best credentials to represent the G3V subtype among stars classified by 
Keenan over his lifetime. You may grit your teeth now.
