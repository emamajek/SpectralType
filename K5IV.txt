K5IV

Keenan89 lists HD 12524 as a K5IV standard, the latest/coolest
subgiant standard in his list. However, its absolute magnitude
(Mv ~ -0.2) places it squarely among the giants, 10 mags above the
main sequence. 

Keenan89 standard: HD 12524 (chi Phe) - K5IV
Keenan99 standard: HD 12524 (chi Phe) - K5IV 

There is one K5IV star among the Hipparcos stars with d < 75 pc, but
its Mv is ~7.4, i.e. within 0.5 mag of the main sequence.

(B-V)(K5IV) = 1.490 ; deprecated standard chi Phe = HD 12524 = HR 602

Mv(K5IV) = -0.25 ; deprecated standard chi Phe = HD 12524 = HR 602

  (Morel78). Cousins71 photometric standard star. 2MASS photometry is
  poor (+-0.3 mag errors). Lafrasse10 lists Teff = 4050 K, logg=1.7,
  but they are "adopted from spectral type".  This
  is 10.0 mags(!) above the MS for B-V = 1.485, so it is clearly a
  *giant*, not a subgiant. I would adopt Houk's "K5III" and not use it
  as a standard considering that there are already other good K5III
  standards. E(B-V)=0.002(Kervella19). Mv=-0.25(Mermilliod91,GaiaDR2).
