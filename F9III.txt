F9III

The only quoted F9III standard (psi^3 Psc by Keenan) is considered
G0IIIa by most other authors.

Keenan89 standard: psi^3 Psc (=HD 6903) - F9IIIa 

# No standard

MK43, JM53, MorganAbt72, Houk, MK78, GrayNstars, and GrayCorbally10 do
not list a F9III standard.

None of the stars in Skiff's (2010) compiled catalog of spectral types
lists a star with "F9III" type from multiple references. None of
Gray's papers lists any "F9III" stars.

# Weak standard 

psi^3 Psc = 81 Psc = HR 339
  G0III: Harlan69,MorganAbt72(stan),MK73(dagger),Gray89,GrayNstars,GrayCorbally10
  G0IIIa: Gray01
  F9IIIa: Keenan89(stan)
  F5III: Adams35

  Considered "G0III" by nearly everyone, but F9III by Keenan89. Part
  of the nebulous F9/G0 boundary between Morgan and Keenan's
  works. I'd stick with Morgan/Gray/Corbally on "G0IIIa"
  vs. Keenan's "F9IIIa". Arguably, 31 Com has a stronger pedigree at
  "G0III" than 81 Psc.
