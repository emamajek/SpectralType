O2V

The primary O2V standard is BI 253.

Walborn02 defined the O2V class with BI 253.

Skiff08 did not flag any stars as O2V standards.

Teff(O2V) = 50906 K ; Weidner10

Mv(O2V) = -6.09 ; Martins05 (SpT vs Mv linear trend; stdev = 0.45 mag)

logg(O2V) = 3.922+-0.15 ; Martins05

Mass(O2V) = 83+9-23 Msun (Weidner10)

# Notes

Hoglado20 made an interesting observation regarding the HRD positions for early O-type stars: "The most striking feature in both diagrams is the almost complete absence of stars in the mass range between ∼30 and 70 M⊙ to the left the 2 Myr isochrone (or below, in the Kiel diagram). There is a clear offset, which increases with mass, between the theoretical ZAMS and the location of the O-type stars in these diagrams. This trend disappears for stars with ∼85 M⊙, where stars much closer to the ZAMS are found."
