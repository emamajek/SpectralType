M5.5V

Kirkpatrick(in GrayCorbally09) calls GJ 1245AC as the primary M5.5V
standard.  But the star is a 0.1" binary (delta(V)=2.5 mag), and
Reid04 calls component C a M7.0V.

G 208-44AB = GJ 1245AC has remained a M5.5V standard, but recent authors
(Kirkpatrick) consider G 208-45 an M6V. Note that K91 does not list any
M5.5V standards from Boeshaar76. 

KeenanMcNeil76 standard: G208-44 - M5.5eV
Keenan80 standard:       G208-44 - M5.5Ve
Keenan83 standard:       G208-44 - M5.5Ve
Boeshaar85 standards:    G208-44AB - M5.5V
                         G208-45 - M5.5V
Keenan88 standard:	 G208-44 - M5.5Ve 
Keenan89 standard:	 G208-44 - M5.5Ve
Kirkpatrick91 standards: G208-44 (=GJ 1245AC) (pri. standard)
	      		 GJ 65A - M5.5V  (pri. standard)
			 LHS3339 - M5.5V (sec. standard)

In my opinion, probably the best (brightest, and known to be single)
M5V standard would be Proxima Centauri (GJ 551). It is not clear why
it has not been previously mentioned as a standard.

According to RECONS list, Prox Cen (GJ 551; J1429-6240) is the closest
M5.5V, followed by GJ 65A (J0139-1757), GJ 473B (J1233+0901), GJ 1002
(J00006-0732).

Note: see dichotomy in Teff (~200K) from SED fit (Rajpurohit)
vs. interferometric methods (Boyajian, Segranson). Proxima is somewhat
metal rich ([Fe/H] = 0.19), so its Teff is probably hotter than the
typical solar metallicity M5.5.

  Washington Double Star catalog lists GJ 65 (WDS 01388-1758 = LDS
  838) as a 2.1" binary as of epoch 2010, with V mags of 12.7(A) and
  13.2(B). The companion (GJ 65B, LHS 10) is the infamous star "UV
  Ceti".  Joy74, Kirkpatrick91, and Henry02 call consider the pair of
  stars A & B to be M5.5V and M6.0V, respectively. Reid04 lists GJ
  65AB as M5.5V, but lists B as a M5.5V also. So most experts consider
  A & B to be ~0.5 subtype different, and they are ~0.5 mag different
  in V magnitude. It's not obvious that such a system is optimal for
  use as a standard star(s), especially if one is not blessed with <1"
  seeing. Geyer88 estimates parallax = 375+-4 mas. The 2MASS JHK and
  Mermilliod91 UBV photometry for GJ 65AB is unresolved. Leggett96
  models both together, with flux 1.31e-11 W/m^2, logL=-2.54,

  Hawley97 says its a 0.8" binary with delta Vmag = 0.3. It is not
  obvious to me that a known barely-resolved binary should be a strong
  spectral standard star. Henry, Johnson, McCarthy, & Kirkpatrick
  (1992) studied the Wolf 424 system in detail: spectrum very similar
  to Gl 65A (M5.5V), and masses of 0.12-0.15 Msun for A, and 0.11-0.12
  Msun for B, and M_K(A) = 8.46+-0.10, M_K(B) =
