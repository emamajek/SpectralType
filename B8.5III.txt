    STAR". AbtMorgan69 notes "(B) This star (Mv = -1.4) shows all of
    the strongest Mn II lines in its spectrum; these lines are sharp -
    as is also the K line and the Si II doublet 4128-31; the He I
    lines \lambda\lambda 4471 and 4026 appear diffuse. The line
    \lambda 3984, identified by Bidelman with Hg II, is present."
