B9.5IV

Garrison77 (nor anyone else) lists any B9.5IV standards.

  Mermilliod91: V=2.948+-0.010, B-V=-0.046+-0.005, U-B=-0.079+-0.017.
  => updated Q-method => E(B-V) = -0.018 (apparently unreddened given
  the photometric errors) => hence, (B-V)o = -0.046, (U-B)o = -0.079,
  E(B-V) = Av = 0.00. VanLeeuwen07 plx = 37.55+-0.16 mas => D =
  26.6+-0.1 pc. The photometric distance (assuming the star is on the
  ZAMS) is ~23+-5 pc. Mv = 0.81 and delta(Mv) = -0.23 - hence close to
  the main sequence. Delta(V)=5.5 binary.  So it looks like this this
  is now a B9.5, and most say dwarf. Teffs: 10162K(Erspamer03),
  10580+-400K(Zorec09).
