  10th nearest L dwarf in SIMBAD as of 5/2024, but a L-dwarf binary
  (inferred from spectrum, but apparently not resolved).  Object first
  reported in Cruz03. Included in a HST Snapshot survey to find
  binarity among L dwarfs by Reid06, but it was considered
  "unresolved". Primary is apparently L3.5 but secondary L6.5
  dominates in near-IR. plx=110.31+-0.29mas(Kirkpatrick20),
  plx=109.7651+-0.2782mas(GaiaDR3).  G=18.807192+-0.004313(GaiaDR3).

  Peculiar, red (J-Ks=2.38) L dwarf discovered by
  Looper08(2008ApJ...686..528L).  7th nearest L dwarf in SIMBAD as of
  5/2024, and Kirkpatrick21 adopts overall type L6.5. Looper08
  reports: "In the near-infrared, 2MASS J21481628+4003593 shows a
  triangular H-band spectrum, strong CO absorption, and a markedly red
  J-Ks color (2.38Â±0.06) for its L6 optical spectral type" and "The
  continuum of 2MASS J2148+4003 shortward of 8600A matches very well
  that of the L6 dwarf, including the TiO band heads, while the atomic
  line strengths of Rb I, Na I, and Cs I are slightly weaker.  We
  therefore adopt an optical spectral type of L6 for 2MASS J2148+4003.
  2MASS J2148+4003 also shows Li absorption in its spectrum.  Using
  the same method described for 2MASS J1821+1414, we measure an EW of
  12.1+-0.6A."  Red J-Ks color is suggestive of low gravity/youth (see
  e.g. Fig. 5 of Schneider14, and indeed it is considered an Argus
  member (Gagne14,Gagne15,Schneider17), which would make it ~40 Myr
  old.  plx=123.6752+-0.3595mas(GaiaDR3),
  G=19.818087+-0.004413(GaiaEDR3).  Y=15.48+-0.05(Liu16),
  J-Ks=2.382+-0.037(2MASS,Looper08).  M_G=20.28, M_J=14.61, M_H=13.24,
  M_Ks=12.23. Teffs: 1446+-72K(Kirkpatrick21).
