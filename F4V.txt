F4V

Garrison94 does not list a F4V anchor standard, nor does MK73 list
a F4V dagger standard.

# No standard

JM53, Morgan65, MK73, MorganAbt73, Cowley74, Houk75, Cowley76, MK78,
Keenan85, Corbally86, Gray89, GrayNstars do not list a F4V standard.
MorganAbt73 lists F3V (B-V=0.40) and F5V (B-V=0.44) standards, but no
F4V standards.

Skiff08 did not flag any stars as F4V MK standards.

Houk does not treat F4 as a full type, and does not list a standard.

Houk lists one F4V star in her catalogs: HD 179512, however this star
has no other published classifications in the Skiff MK catalog.

It would appear that there are no generally agreed-upon F4V standard
stars before Pecaut13 (who adopted HD 27561).

# Primary standard

HD 27561 = (Hyad; one of Morgan's 2 F4V Hyads)
 *F4V: Morgan65,Pecaut12(stan)
  F5V: Jaschek64,Jaschek78(Eggen50)
  F5IV-V: Treanor60,Gray01
  F6V: Davis77
  F6: Wilson48
  F0: Cannon

  Unfortunately, only Morgan65 calls it F4V.  B-V = 0.412 -- so it is
  intermediate between F3V and F5V Hyades. Based on its intermediate
  appearance between F3V and F5V spectra and its colors, Pecaut12
  adopts this as a F4V standard. Mass = 1.43 Msun(Casagrande11),
  1.47 Msun(Roeser11) => median(mass) = 1.45 Msun. 

# Notes on the search for a suitable standard

Gray06 lists 14 F4V stars with Teff estimates. The stars with two
median Teff estimates are HD 139664 (HIP 76829) and HD 77370 (HIP
44143).  HD 77370 was listed as an F3V by both Houk75 and
Gray89(!). HD 139664 has a range of published types (F2-F5).

Morgan65 classifed two Hyads as F4V or variant: HD 27561 (F4V) and HD
27901 (F4Vn). Morgan65 classified a few Hyades dwarfs as "F4V". His
grid of fundamental standards had F3 and F6, but no intermediate
standards. His F4V stars were: HD 27561 (=BD+14_687) and HD 27901
(BD+18_633).  Gray01 calls HD 27561 a "F5IV-V", and most other authors
consider the star F5 or F6 as well. HD 27901 is discussed later, but
has been variously considered A9,F2, or F3. Neither star seem worthy
of calling a standard given their range in published types.

There is a noticeable lack of stars classified as F4V by multiple authors.

Only four of the "pure" F4V stars from Gray et al. (2001,2003,2006)
have been previously classified as F4V. None of these would seem to be
worthy of calling a standard. HD 160032 at least has two Gray
references with the same type.

Note that Hyades F3Vs have B-V ~ 0.39, and F5Vs have B-V ~ 0.43-0.44.
