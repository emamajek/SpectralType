K7.5V

No good standard. 

Keenan83 standard: Gl 638 (=HD 151288) - K7.5Ve
Keenan85 standard: Gl 638 (=HD 151288) - K7.5Ve
Keenan88 standard: Gl 638 (=HD 151288) - K7.5Ve
Keenan89 standard: Gl 638 (=HD 151288) - K7.5Ve

<V-J>(K7.5V) = 2.89 (+-0.16 stdev) ; Lepine12

Teff(K7.5V) = 3883+-82 K ; Lepine12

Note that Lepine12 does not contain subtypes between K7.5V and M0V.

  Keenan called it K7.5V, so one might suppose this is halfway between K7V and M0V
  since he didn't use K8 or K9 subtypes.
