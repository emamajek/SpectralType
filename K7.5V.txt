Keenan88 standard: Gl 638 (=HD 151288) - K7.5Ve
Keenan89 standard: Gl 638 (=HD 151288) - K7.5Ve

<V-J>(K7.5V) = 2.89 (+-0.16 stdev) ; Lepine12

  K7V: JM53(non-standard),Wilson62,Jaschek78,Gray03,Kirkpatrick(unpub.,DwarfArchive)
  K7.5Ve: Keenan83,Keenan89

  M0V: Adams26,Keenan47

  Jaschek64 shows 8 publications w/ K7V and one with M0V.  Appears to
  be overwhelmingly K7V (including recent classifications by Gray and
  Kirkpatrick), but Keenan listed K7.5V multiple times.
